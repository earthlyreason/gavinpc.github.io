# Sharing is Caring

Once upon a time and a very good time it was some people had a problem.  And they didn't know where to turn.  So they turned to a social worker for help.  And lo, the social workers did very good works.  But then they found that they themselves needed help.  And so it was, that someone was needed to help the helpers.

## An endless chain of helping

We have lots of experience helping, and even some experience helping the helpers of people.  At some point, we also need help.  That is how the chain of helping grows.

If you, too, want to be a part of this chain of helping, or let's say succession or family or something, because "chain" sounds so bad---I say, if you want to join this circle of helping, then by all means contact us by the preferred means, which we shall link to below.
