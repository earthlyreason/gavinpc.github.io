## Parenting is hard

Right now I'm listening to my children screaming upstairs---both of them, screaming.  And when they stop crying and wailing, they just say "Mama, mama, mama, mama" over and over again, then stomp on the floor and bang the wall... so yeah it's just another Friday night.  There was a neighborhood thing at a local club, but we missed it.  Bop-Bop got stitches.  I'm not supposed to look at them.

### Another topic

Sorry, I can't think right now, so you want me to talk about something *else*?  Umm, well the weather is lovely today.  Sorry, it's really hard to think with this crying and shouting.  So recently I was thinking I'd start reading again, like books.  I stopped at some point, I can't remember why.  It seems like everybody stopped except the people who are promoting their books.  Writing is somehow easier than reading.

### Making simple web sites for free

Ah, well, you get what you pay for.  I made this little site on GitHub pages to try it out, and for sharing some thoughts in a semi-structured way, it's way easier than writing code.  But you still have to know markdown and know your way around GitHub somewhat.  I suppose that's a small price to pay for having no price to pay.  I can't vouch for any of the other free-as-in-beer services but I know that they aren't in the business of altruism.  As the old saying goes, "If you're not paying, then you're the product."
